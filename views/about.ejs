            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
            <p>The Technical Education Department, Govt. of Rajasthan, faces several challenges in fostering meaningful interactions between alumni and current students. Key issues include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Centralized System:</strong> Currently, there is no centralized system to track and update alumni information such as contact details, specialization, and career paths. This results in ineffective communication and engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Need for Structured Interaction:</strong> Without organized platforms, students miss out on valuable real-world experiences and mentorship from alumni.</li>
                <li><strong>Need for Motivation and Guidance:</strong> Many students lack motivation and guidance for career clarity. Alumni can serve as essential mentors and role models, providing insights and advice based on their experiences.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Create an Alumni Database:</strong> Develop a centralized database to store and update alumni information, including employment status, contact details, educational achievements, and areas of expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>Build an Engagement Platform:</strong> Design and implement an online platform with features like:
